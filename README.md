## FAQ
### 1. What's new with this new tab?
Looks, customizability and productivity! I just tried to make something that has totally different vibes compared to other new tab apps. I also like to listen lofi-songs in my free time, so I made a new tab page that has a lofi-music player in-built:)

### 2. What features are you going to add in the future?
I have a lot of stuff in my mind. I can make a lot more customizable, by adding color customizability, few more modules like daily quotes, website shortcuts,
and many wallpapers from chillhop itself. Honestly I feel that I should have made the website shortcuts thing at least, but I am moving towards a really tight schedule, so that's for some other day.

### 3. Music isn't playing, or buffering too much, what should I do?
Try reloading or hard reloading, or maybe try changing the station. I honestly don't know why chillhop api returns so many 404 endpoints, but I will do more research on it later on, till then, that's what you can do.... OR You can make the fix yourself and send a PR! I would happily review the code ASAP.
